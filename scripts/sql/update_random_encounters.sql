      {"id":"0578a030-8265-4a72-b16b-6ce0da4838e7","cells":["1","Echoing Footsteps","The party hears extra footsteps matching their pace but no one is there. If they stop: the footsteps stop a heartbeat later. If they call out: only their own voices reply... slightly delayed."]},
      {"id":"6FE5A40E-82FB-4EDD-98C9-86FF3F4BC9AD","cells":["2","Wrong Season Patch","They pass a 20-30 foot patch where the season is wrong: Snow in summer, flowers in winter, autumn leaves drifting in spring. Animals step around it and refuse to enter. Investigating reveals no clear source, just a faint tingling or ringing in the ears."]},
      {"id":"0750E311-5CE8-4EFF-A719-B8B10E5A2FBD","cells":["3","Chattering Rocks","Pebbles along the roadside click together like teeth when disturbed. If picked up, two pebbles \"murmur\" unintelligibly when held close. Dropping them stops the sound instantly."]},
      {"id":"F14722D2-1FF4-45C2-ADBB-4EED5387139F","cells":["4","Lantern Moths","At dusk, tiny glowing moths gather around the party''s torches or light spells. They shift colour with the party''s mood (angry = red, calm = blue, etc.). If attacked, they scatter harmlessly... but leave behind a brief afterimage of some other forest."]},
      {"id":"59A5A2CA-549C-4470-BE11-E6849D05F481","cells":["5","Lost Time Mile","The party walks a stretch of road that feels normal, but: When they next check the sun/sky, more time has passed than expected (by an hour or two). No memory of stopping or detouring. Tracks show they walked straight the whole time."]},
      {"id":"4F3AF860-B7A1-4760-A758-B60CBEB78817","cells":["6","The Laughing Scarecrow","A lone scarecrow by a field turns its head to watch them as they pass. If someone addresses it kindly, it lets out a short, wheezing laugh and points its straw arm toward somewhere off-road (you decide where). If destroyed, the field''s crops wither slightly overnight."]},
      {"id":"C86FAB41-70CE-484D-8CAF-FAA703E68A4E","cells":["7","Doppel Silhouettes","At sunset, their shadows split: each PC has a second, fainter shadow facing a different direction. The faint shadows mimic different poses – sometimes heroic, sometimes mocking. After a minute or two, they snap back to normal."]},
      {"id":"00B9CD06-C535-4385-A0F9-70118F176E17","cells":["8","Reversed Rain","A small localised cloud appears overhead. It starts to rain upwards – droplets rise from puddles and grass toward the cloud. Anyone standing in it feels lightly pulled upward in their gut, but stays grounded. Lasts a minute; then the cloud pops like a soap bubble."]},
      {"id":"A9FE0144-D179-4555-A0DF-AAF10AADF04E","cells":["9","BATTLE",""]},
      {"id":"C6AAA59D-8F6D-4DAD-88DC-0D89EAC3E652","cells":["10","Singing Wind in the Branches","Wind through a clump of trees produces recognisable melody fragments. It might echo a lullaby, a tavern song, or a tune none of them know but can hum afterward. Trying to follow the song deeper into the trees always loops them back to the road."]},
      {"id":"7DF5BB34-76D5-4BF9-9704-8E46D36DD1CF","cells":["11","Animal Audience","When they camp, a ring of small animals (rabbits, foxes, owls, etc.) quietly gathers at a distance. They just watch. Any performance (song, story, sparring) makes them visibly attentive. At the end, they disperse; one tiny item is left behind (a feather, a carved wooden bead, a perfectly round stone)."]},

      {"id":"8B65FE52-1DC3-4639-88C9-17AED14DB4FF","cells":["13","Inverted Campfire","At night, if they light a fire: The flames burn downward, drooping toward the ground, while smoke coils straight up like a rigid column. The fire still gives normal heat. Dousing it makes a brief shower of cold sparks that tingle on the skin."]},
      {"id":"4E497BD2-8066-49E8-BEF9-926D0C242F42","cells":["14","Whispering Clothesline","A rope or old clothesline across the path has tattered cloths hanging. They flutter and whisper snatches of gossip in different voices when touched or walked under. The gossip is about no one the party recognises... yet."]},
      {"id":"008C76D1-E889-44D2-AE3A-AF6DFAF6FFF2","cells":["15","Colour Drain Path","For a short distance, colours desaturate; everything looks washed-out. Any colourful object crossing this area appears grey for a few minutes afterward, then slowly regains colour. Living things are unaffected mechanically, but it feels wrong."]},
      {"id":"14AEADBA-B3F1-4110-B591-ABDEA9478E89","cells":["16","The Silent Herd","The party spots a small herd of deer / wild goats / cows standing perfectly still, all facing the same direction. They do not react to being approached until touched; then they bolt in eerie synchrony. The ground where they stood feels cooler and oddly springy."]},
      {"id":"E7DD51AA-F6E1-4BAB-9B03-BC5CBA77F1A8","cells":["17","Talking Mud Puddle","A muddy puddle gives off faint bubbling \"syllables\" when stepped around. If someone peers into it, they might see a distorted face mouthing one clear word (you choose – a name, \"turn\", \"soon\", etc.). Disturbing the water breaks the image."]},
      {"id":"2BFBDEB7-5E88-422F-88A8-B605AA006542","cells":["18","Unhelpful Will-o''-Wisps","Soft lights appear among the trees at night, hovering just out of reach. They do not try to lure anyone into danger; they just mirror the party''s movements. Following them simply circles back to camp or the road. They wink out if attacked or ignored for long."]},
      {"id":"F635839E-A8D5-4969-A5CD-D8E4AB7F2051","cells":["19","Shared Dream Flash","As they walk, everyone blinks at the same time and, just for a heartbeat, each sees the same vision: A swampy path under foreign constellations, a crooked cottage on stilts, or a towering clockwork shadow. Then they''re back on the road, mid-step."]},
      {"id":"F66E5F07-6C73-4464-BA35-4464990B04A8","cells":["20","BATTLE",""]}
